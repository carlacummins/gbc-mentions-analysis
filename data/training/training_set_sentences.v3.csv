HPA,HPA,0,PMC11977098,Psychiatric conditions are often linked to dysfunction of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis. The Endocannabinoid System (ECS) plays a significant role in stress and anxiety and interacts with the HPA axis.
HPA,HPA,0,PMC11977098,ACTH stimulates the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex—cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents—which initiate downstream actions for stress response and feedback control of the HPA axis [ 9 ].
HPA,HPA,0,PMC11977098,"With growing interest in the use of FAAH inhibitors as a new treatment avenue for psychiatric conditions associated with HPA axis dysfunction and recent human clinical trials [ 41 - 43 ], understanding the effects of FAAH inhibition on HPA axis function is increasingly important."
HPA,HPA,0,PMC11977098,Rodent studies offer the opportunity to enhance our understanding of HPA response to FAAH inhibition as this topic has been more extensively studied in this population compared to the relatively sparse literature in humans.

NCT,NCT,0,PMC12180258,"The results showed that NICT was independently associated with improved OS (HR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.41–0.93,p= 0.021) compared to NCT."
NCT,NCT,0,PMC12180258,"# METHODS ## STUDY DESIGN AND PATIENT SELECTION This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with locally advanced ESCC (clinical stage II-IV) who underwent treatment with NCRT or NCT with or without immunotherapy, followed by surgical resection between March 2020 and March 2024 at Meizhou People’s Hospital."
NCT,NCT,0,PMC12180258,"NICT cohort exhibited superior survival, with a median overall survival not reached compared to 31.2 months (95% CI 26.4–36.0) for NCRT and 34.5 months (95% CI 28.7–40.3) for NCT."
NCT,NCT,0,PMC12180258,"Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NCT): docetaxel 60 mg/m² on Day 1, cisplatin 60 mg/m² on Day 1, and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m² continuous infusion over 24 h for 5 days), repeated every 3 weeks for 2–3 cycles."
NCT,NCT,0,PMC12180258,"Despite concerns about immunotherapy exacerbating chemotherapy toxicity, NICT showed lower hematologic toxicity than NCT/NCRT, possibly due to shorter chemotherapy cycles (median 2 vs. 3 cycles in NCRT)."
NCT,NCT,0,PMC12180258,"Of these, 30 patients received NCT, 61 received NCRT, and 84 received NICT."
NCT,NCT,0,PMC12180258,Standard treatment for resectable ESCC includes NCT or NCRT followed by radical esophagectomy.
NCT,NCT,0,PMC12180258,"However, findings from CMISG1701, JCOG1109, and a recent network meta-analysis suggest that NCRT may not confer additional survival benefits compared to NCT alone [7–9]."
NCT,NCT,0,PMC12180258,"Despite advances in neoadjuvant therapy for ESCC, the integration of immunotherapy into preoperative regimens lacks robust comparative evidence against conventional NCT/NCRT, particularly regarding long-term survival and surgical safety—a gap our study directly addresses [17]."
NCT,NCT,0,PMC12180258,"Studies such as CROSS, NEOCLTEC5010, and JCOG9907 have demonstrated that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) extends overall survival compared to surgery alone in locally advanced ESCC [3–6]."
NCT,NCT,0,PMC12180258,"In this context, our study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety among NCT, NCRT, and NICT in terms of oncologic efficacy, treatment-related adverse events, rates of subsequent surgery, and postoperative recovery for resectable locally advanced ESCC."
NCT,NCT,0,PMC12097862,"However, studies that compared the efficacy of NCET and NET/NCT in ER+ breast cancer patients were still limited, and only one known systematic review analyzed the efficacy of three different neoadjuvant regimens in terms of pCR and overall response rate (ORR) in HR-positive breast cancer."

NCT,NCT,0,PMC12097862,"Second, the number of studies reporting CR and pCR numbers was limited between NCET and NET/NCT groups."

NCT,NCT,0,PMC12097862,"For instance, previous studies have reported that NET yielded a similar clinical response rate (cRR) to NCT while exhibiting lower toxicity [7]."
NCT,NCT,0,PMC12097862,"Because the number of studies comparing the difference in efficacy between NCET and NET/NCT is small, the available data only supported the subgroup analysis of CR and pCR."
NCT,NCT,0,PMC12097862,"Regarding CR, the pooled results for HER-2− subgroups were consistent with the original analysis, with fewer CR patents in the NET group than in the NCT group (OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.36 to 0.69;I2= 41.1%)."
NCT,NCT,0,PMC12097862,"Based on menopausal status, NR subgroup analysis showed that there was no difference in the number of CR between the NCET group and the NCT/NET group (OR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.08 to 11.08;I2= 78.5%)."
