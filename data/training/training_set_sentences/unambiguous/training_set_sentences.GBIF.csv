GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC11994295,"Using mainland Afrotropical records for Catharsius Hope, 1837 (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), we compared inventory completeness of GBIF data to a dataset which combined these with records from a recent taxonomic revision."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC11994295,"We found that the number of cells for which inventory completeness could be calculated, as well as coverage of climate types by ‘well‐sampled’ cells, increased threefold when using the combined set compared to the GBIF set."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC11994295,"Improvements to sampling in Central and Western Africa were particularly striking, and coverage of rare climates was similarly improved, as not a single well‐sampled cell from the GBIF data alone occurred in the rarest climate types."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC11994295,"These findings support existing literature that suggests data gaps on GBIF are still pervasive, especially for insects and in the tropics, and so, is not yet ready to serve as a standalone data source for all taxa."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC11904309,"Such databases have two major limitations: (i) data may be spatially biased because traditionally surveyed areas are in rural habitats and (ii) there is a time lag between formal monitoring and survey data collection and assimilation into GBIF, which means rapid range shifts cannot be tracked."
GBIF,GBIF,0,True,PMC11904309,"The complementarity of GBIF and social media data, however, has rarely been assessed, particularly when tracking range shifts."
GBIF,GBIF,0,True,PMC11904309,"To address these knowledge gaps, we compare the habitat usage revealed by biological records of the Jersey tiger moth from GBIF and from social media data sources (Instagram and Flickr)."
GBIF,GBIF,0,True,PMC12074807,"To represent the knowledge accumulated by traditional means up until the completion of the IBA survey, we downloaded all Swedish lepidopteran occurrence data from GBIF for the time period up until and including 2019."
GBIF,GBIF,0,True,PMC12052474,"The GBIF brings records from different sources, such as articles, museum collections, and citizen records, among others."
GBIF,GBIF,0,True,PMC11371663,"To account for geographic bias in GBIF data due to the clustering of points in cities or along major roads, the data was downscaled to match the resolution of the climate grid, 2.5 arc‐min, so that each grid cell associated with genera presence has the same weight in niche calculations."
GBIF,GBIF,0,True,PMC11371663,The data that support the findings of this study are openly available from GBIF (2023) with specific data references included in Appendix 1 .

GBIF,GBIF,0,True,PMC11614047,"No records have been published in a peer-reviewed journal since then, but additional records (5 human observations and 12 herbarium specimens) have been published on GBIF ( https://www.gbif.org/ ; GBIF Secretariat 2023 )."

GBIF,GBIF,0,True,PMC11911025,"The occurrence dataset comprised 190 records: 170 data points were sourced from the GBIF ( www.gbif.org ), whereas 20 additional records were obtained from published literature (Chaudhri 1957 ; Kakiuchi et al."

GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC11994295,"In this study, we aim to quantify potential gains to insect data on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) through further digitisation of natural history collections, assess to what degree this would fill biases in spatial and environmental record coverage, and deepen understanding of environmental bias with regard to climate rarity."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC11904309,"Range shifts are generally documented using databases such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), which largely contain data from monitoring schemes and wildlife surveys."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC11904309,"Alternative data sources, such as social media, could provide information on species distributions and range shifts that compensate for spatial biases in GBIF records because social media data may be collected outside traditionally surveyed areas."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC12074807,"Lepidoptera are among the best-known and described insect orders worldwide ( https://gbif.org ), and thus the expected composition of regional species pools is unusually well established."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC12074807,"In 2023, thousands of amateur and professional naturalists together reported an average of more than 120 occurrence records per species of Swedish Lepidoptera ( https://gbif.org ), at least an order of magnitude more than for any other group of insects."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC12074807,All major sources of data on Swedish Lepidoptera known to us are available through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; https://gbif.org ).
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC12074807,"We restricted our download to human observations, preserved specimens and the Artportalen dataset (Species Observation System of Artdatabanken, https://artportalen.se ) as it represents the bulk of occurrence data in GBIF."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC12052474,The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is the most comprehensive open database of biological records on a global scale (Girardello et al.
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC12052474,"The difference between GBIF and IUCN spatial data is that the former consists mainly of records in georeferenced points format, while the IUCN provides distribution polygons for species, which are often interpretations of GBIF data interpreted by experts (Boitani et al."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC12052474,"Therefore, GBIF data are likely to have fewer co‐omission errors than IUCN data, and IUCN data may underestimate areas with gaps in distribution information by assuming species distributions in areas where no data are available—due to the use of polygons (IUCN 2024b )."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC12052474,Some authors have proposed that records in the GBIF (especially those coming from citizens' contributions) might exhibit misidentification issues and bias: areas of higher human population density correlating with the number of species records (Girardello et al.
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC11371663,"Global occurrence data was downloaded from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, 2023) for all nine families and filtered to include focal genera and distribution points in Australia (Appendix 1 )."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC11371663,Some GBIF species occurrence points (less than 1 percent) did not overlap with the climate grid due to the climate grid's lower precision along coastlines and waterways and were excluded.
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC11700496,"We used occurrence data for the selected species obtained from GBIF ( GBIF, 2023a ; GBIF, 2023b ; GBIF, 2023c ; GBIF, 2023d ), as well as solar and bioclimatic data from BioClim (WorldClim, 2020), and topography data from EarthEnv ( Amatulli et al., 2018 )."

GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC10870231,"The dataset submitted to GBIF is structured as a sample event dataset that has been published as a Darwin Core Archive (DwCA), which is a standardised format for sharing biodiversity data as a set of one or more data tables."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC11428515,"Species occurrence records were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility database (GBIF: https://www.gbif.org/ , accessed on 3 March 2023), the Plant Photo Bank of China (PPBC: http://ppbc.iplant.cn/ , accessed on 3 March 2023), the National Specimen Information Infrastructure database (NSII: http://nsii.org.cn/2017/home.php , accessed on 3 March 2023), and our field surveys."
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC11513410,They frequently originate from specimens deposited in scientific collections and opportunistic observations and are available through global aggregators such as GBIF (the Global Biodiversity Information Facility).
GBIF,GBIF,1,True,PMC11513410,"Second, high-quality biodiversity data, for which we know the exact sampling effort and methods and where both species’ presences and absences are recorded, are rarely shared through the GBIF initiative."
