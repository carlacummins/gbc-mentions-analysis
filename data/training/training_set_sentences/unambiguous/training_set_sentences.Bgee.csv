Bgee,Bgee,1,True,PMC12082848,"The Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics develops two databases across multi-species for the study of gene expression and orthology: Bgee and Orthologous MAtrix (OMA, an orthology database)."
Bgee,Bgee,1,True,PMC12082848,"This study combines the RIKEN BioResource data with Resource Description Framework (RDF) datasets from Bgee, a gene expression database, the OMA, the DisGeNET, a human gene-disease association, Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI), UniProt, and four disease ontologies in the RIKEN BioResource MetaDatabase."
Bgee,Bgee,0,True,PMC12082848,"Finally, we compared the performance of the federated SPARQL query via the remote Bgee SPARQL endpoint with the performance of a centralized SPARQL query using the Bgee dataset as part of the RIKEN BioResource MetaDatabase."
Bgee,Bgee,1,True,PMC12082848,"For this study, we used two of the SIB RDF datasets for the study of gene expression and orthology: Bgee and OMA."
Bgee,Bgee,1,True,PMC12082848,Bgee [ 10 ] is a well-established gene expression database that integrates curated healthy wild-type expression data across a wide range of data sources to provide a comparable reference of normal gene expression across multiple animal species.
Bgee,Bgee,1,True,PMC7698756,"At the next step, we performed the comparisons of expression patterns of GV-related genes in different tissues with the use of Bgee [ 49 ]."
Bgee,Bgee,1,True,PMC7698756,Comparative analysis of the expression of GV-related genes in the tissues was carried out by the “Expression comparison” function ( https://bgee.org/?page=expression_comparison ) provided on the website of Bgee resource [ 49 ].
