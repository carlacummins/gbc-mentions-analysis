Catalogue of Life,Catalogue of Life,1,True,PMC10744909,"At the same time, taxonomists involved in herbarium digitization are also using different repositories (such as GBIF, the Catalogue of Life, and ChecklistBank) so that they can also suggest what “entity” can fit the required standards for the maintenance of a global species list [ 69 ]."
Catalogue of Life,Catalogue of Life,1,True,PMC6530169,A collection of organism names (uBiota) was compiled by unification of taxonomy from three different sources: (1) Catalogue of Life (COL) [ 16 ]; (2) Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) ( https://www.itis.gov/ ); and (3) National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Taxonomy [ 8 ].
Catalogue of Life,Catalogue of Life,1,True,PMC8149864,"The result was the initiation of global data resources such as the Catalogue of Life (CoL; a global index of known species) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; an aggregator and distributor of species occurrence records), both established in 2001."
Catalogue of Life,Catalogue of Life,1,True,PMC8149864,"It will be mapped to Catalogue of Life (CoL) enabling international distribution, once GBIF has adopted CoL as its taxonomic backbone, and CoL will then also provide the taxonomy for non-native taxa in FinBIF."
