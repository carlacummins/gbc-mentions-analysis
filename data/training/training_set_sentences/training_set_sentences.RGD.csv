RGD,RGD,0,True,PMC12103621,"Specifically, integrin αvβ6 requires a higher tension of approximately 200 pN to activate cell spreading 24 , a requirement that starkly contrasts with the lower, cell type-independent threshold of around 40 pN needed for RGD-binding integrins 25 ."

RGD,RGD,0,True,PMC12123436,"Unlike common iridium( iii ) complexes, excitation of conjugate 1-RGD and complex 2 resulted in weak emission and negligible singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) generation due to the quenching effect of the tetrazine unit."
RGD,RGD,0,True,PMC12123436,"Upon continuous light irradiation, the S , S -tetrazine moiety in conjugate 1-RGD and complex 2 underwent efficient photodissociation, yielding thiocyanate (3) and amide (4) complexes as photoproducts with increased emission intensities and enhanced 1 O 2 generation efficiencies."
