IntAct,IntAct,0,True,PMC12104377,The absence of subordinate representation in both LSF and HSF compared to intact stimuli further implies that full SF content is essential for fine-category processing.
IntAct,IntAct,0,True,PMC12104377,"To examine the effect of SF content on categorical representation at multiple levels, the responses of IT and STS neurons to various visual stimuli in three levels of abstraction and three levels of SF content (i.e., intact, high, and low) are recorded."
IntAct,IntAct,0,True,PMC12104377,"We show that mid-level categories (e.g., face-body) are represented at all levels of SF content, while in sub-ordinate levels (e.g., identity), only the intact stimuli are represented in IT and STS neurons."

IntAct,IntAct,0,True,PMC12126613,"Specifically, in both spinal and intact cats, there are muscle activity burst groups comprising either flexor or extensor muscles and some of these groups contain muscles operating at different joints (Desrochers et al., 2019 ; Harnie et al., 2021 ; Higgin et al., 2020 ; Klishko et al., 2021 ; Krouchev et al., 2006 ; Markin et al., 2012 )."

IntAct,IntAct,0,False,PMC12097905,The removal of either the calyx or corolla generally reduced floral temperatures compared to intact flowers.
IntAct,IntAct,0,False,PMC12097905,"The floral temperatures of a calyx-removed flower and an adjacent intact flower at the same stage, as well as the ambient temperature, were recorded simultaneously."

IntAct,IntAct,0,True,PMC12112643,Our findings highlight the role of SWD in the primary infestation of intact grape berries and underscore the importance of considering interspecific interactions when interpreting results based on fly emergence from field-collected fruits.
IntAct,IntAct,0,True,PMC12112643,"Moreover, when intact berries were treated as pooled samples, thus allowing interactions among larvae developing in different berries, the proportion of the emerging SWD flies was significantly lower."
IntAct,IntAct,0,True,PMC12112643,"Furthermore, when berries were pooled (placing multiple intact fruits in close proximity and allowing potential interactions between larvae), MTD emergence became even more dominant."
IntAct,IntAct,0,True,PMC12112643,"Even among intact berries, pooling appeared to influence larval emergence, likely due to post-harvest microenvironmental changes such as increased humidity, microbial activity, or subtle skin weakening, which may have allowed limited larval movement or indirect species interactions."
IntAct,IntAct,0,True,PMC12101160,"Gene expression analysis revealed that the podocyte-associated proteins ( NPHS1 , NPHS2 , and PODXL ) were downregulated following PAN injection, and their expression was maintained in the PAN-MSC group similar to the intact group, indicating a protective effect of MSCs at the molecular level."
