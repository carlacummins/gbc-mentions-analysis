SGD,SGD,0,False,PMC12008763,"In this economic evaluation of a simulated cohort of adult patients in Singapore, LVAD's cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was 106 458 in Singapore dollars (SGD; US $79 446) for inotrope-dependent patients and SGD 174 798 (US $130 446) for inotrope-independent patients, with 59% and 19% probabilities of attaining cost-effectiveness, respectively."
SGD,SGD,0,False,PMC12008763,Costs were estimated (in 2023 Singapore dollars [SGD]) using cohort billing data from 2017 to 2022 and National Heart Centre Singapore LVAD charges.
SGD,SGD,0,False,PMC12008763,"Health care costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) evaluated against a threshold of SGD 114 000 (US $85 075) per QALY gained."
SGD,SGD,0,False,PMC12008763,"In the base case analysis, LVAD yielded an additional 3.45 QALYs at an incremental cost of SGD 404 678 (US $301 999), producing an ICER of SGD 117 370 (US $87 590) per QALY gained for the transplant-ineligible population."
SGD,SGD,0,False,PMC12008763,"The ICER differed for inotrope-use subgroups at SGD 106 458 (US $79 446) per QALY gained for inotrope-dependent patients and SGD 174 798 (US $130 446) per QALY gained for inotrope-independent patients (with 59% and 19% probabilities, respectively, of attaining high value)."
SGD,SGD,0,True,PMC11088924,"SGD chromatin was prepared with recombinant yeast histone octamers at a high nucleosome density (histone-to-DNA ratio = 0.8) and incubated with the TF Reb1 and/or the indicated remodelers, leading to the formation of distinct nucleosome density profiles."
SGD,SGD,0,True,PMC11088924,This has been most clearly demonstrated in studies based on reconstitution of yeast chromatin with the salt gradient dialysis (SGD) method ( Figure 1B ) or histone chaperone-based chromatin assembly systems.
SGD,SGD,0,True,PMC11088924,"However, the incubation of SGD chromatin with yeast whole-cell extract and ATP does result in a typical in vivo -like nucleosome positioning pattern [ 35 ]."
