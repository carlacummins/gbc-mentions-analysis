HPA,HPA,0,True,PMC11977098,Psychiatric conditions are often linked to dysfunction of the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal (HPA) axis. The Endocannabinoid System (ECS) plays a significant role in stress and anxiety and interacts with the HPA axis.
HPA,HPA,0,True,PMC11977098,ACTH stimulates the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex—cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents—which initiate downstream actions for stress response and feedback control of the HPA axis [ 9 ].
HPA,HPA,0,True,PMC11977098,"With growing interest in the use of FAAH inhibitors as a new treatment avenue for psychiatric conditions associated with HPA axis dysfunction and recent human clinical trials [ 41 – 43 ], understanding the effects of FAAH inhibition on HPA axis function is increasingly important."
HPA,HPA,0,True,PMC11977098,Rodent studies offer the opportunity to enhance our understanding of HPA response to FAAH inhibition as this topic has been more extensively studied in this population compared to the relatively sparse literature in humans.

HPA,HPA,1,True,PMC11926642,"A possible reason is that the immunogen selection algorithm applied for HPA antibody generation (Berglund, Björling, et al., 2008) was not able to find a protein fragment with low enough sequence identity to the human proteome in these short proteins."

HPA,HPA,1,True,PMC7802108,"As a result, there are some caveats in the HPA data that should be noted. The distribution of how many proteins are histologically scored in each of the 137 cell types varies in HPA, such that not all results are equal."
HPA,HPA,1,True,PMC6734269,"Access of the HPA data is mainly via web-based interface allowing views of individual proteins, which may not be optimal for data analysis of a gene set, or automatic retrieval of original images."
