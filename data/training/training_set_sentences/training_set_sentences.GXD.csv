GXD,GXD,0,False,PMC9193780,"However, it remains unclear how much these gene-diet interactions (GxDs) affect disease risk in human populations."
GXD,GXD,0,False,PMC9193780,Understanding the contribution of GxDs to variability in disease risk factors is thus critical to guide scientific effort as well as prioritize specific dietary exposures for study.
GXD,GXD,0,False,PMC9193780,We set out to quantify the genome-wide contribution of GxDs to the heritability of multiple cardiometabolic risk factors across a wide range of dietary traits.
GXD,GXD,0,False,PMC9193780,"We conducted a genome-wide GxD interaction study for each combination of 12 cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., lipids and glycemic traits) and 20 dietary exposures (macronutrients, micronutrients, and food groups)."
GXD,GXD,0,False,PMC9193780,GxD contributions to heritability (mean of 0.1% variance explained across all diet-trait pairs) were much lower than those from genetic main effects (mean of 16.8% variance explained).

GXD,GXD,0,True,PMC11789628,"Because the GxD signature in WSD motif–containing proteins was proposed to mediate interactions with ISWI1 in diverse eukaryotes ( Aravind and Iyer 2012 ), we assessed whether this signature is needed to form the ISWI1–ICOP complex."

GXD,GXD,0,True,PMC10621921,"Such ""gene-by-diet"", or GxD, interactions have been shown to explain, in great part, why a dietary recommendation that is beneficial for one demographic may be ineffective or even deleterious in another [ 7 – 9 ]."
GXD,GXD,0,True,PMC10621921,"Personalized nutritional guidelines are therefore one promising solution to addressing obesity, though constructing such guidelines will require a continued effort towards establishing an in-depth understanding of GxD effects as well as their epigenetic and transcriptomic bases."
GXD,GXD,0,True,PMC10621921,"Despite the clear importance of identifying GxD interactions governing health effects in humans, there are many limitations to studying GxD in human cohorts [ 10 ]."
GXD,GXD,0,True,PMC10621921,"Here we have designed a new experimental paradigm in which we identify GxD changes in gene expression and DNA methylation in a cohort of genetically diverse mouse strains, apply the pathway analysis from those studies to inform a literature-based selection of a predicted strain-specific drug intervention, and assess the molecular and phenotypic consequences of this intervention in a strain-specific manner ( Fig 1A and 1B )."
