CIViC,CIViC,0,False,PMC11920674,"In a context where decades of conflict and structural violence had crystallised divisive and exclusionary models of civic identity, service delivery, and governance, new partnerships between former MoHS and ECBHO health workers were particularly significant."
CIViC,CIViC,0,False,PMC11920674,"It then details research findings, showing: how social welfare systems in Myanmar historically (re)produced divisive and exclusionary ideas of civic identity; how health workers from different systems have established new partnerships and solidarity since the 2021 coup; how experiences of and responses to suffering have been crucial to building solidarity and moral community; and how the latter has contributed to processes of revolutionary change by (re)shaping constructions of civic identity, social welfare, and governance ‘from below’."
CIViC,CIViC,0,False,PMC12076452,"GAS also correlated with significant societal benefits, including reduced harassment (OR = 0.693; P = 0.0078) and increased civic participation (OR = 1.339; P = 0.0005)."
