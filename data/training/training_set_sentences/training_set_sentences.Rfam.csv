Rfam,Rfam,1,True,PMC11701678,"These updates significantly expand Rfam’s coverage and improve annotation quality, reinforcing its critical role in RNA research, genome annotation and the development of machine learning models."
Rfam,Rfam,1,True,PMC11701678,The Rfam database was established in 2002 ( 1 ) in order to provide a central repository of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) families for genomic annotations.
Rfam,Rfam,1,True,PMC11915505,"With this new information, we have produced new covariance models (CMs), two of which are available at the Rfam database [ 14 ], and demonstrated their utility for tmRNA gene search."
